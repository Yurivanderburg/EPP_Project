	abstract = {The mass of the top quark is measured using a sample of \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{t{\textbackslash}overline\{t\}\}\$ events collected by the CMS detector using proton-proton collisions at \${\textbackslash}sqrt\{s\} =\$ 13 TeV at the CERN LHC. Events are selected with one isolated muon or electron and at least four jets from data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$. For each event the mass is reconstructed from a kinematic fit of the decay products to a \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{t{\textbackslash}overline\{t\}\}\$ hypothesis. Using the ideogram method, the top quark mass is determined simultaneously with an overall jet energy scale factor (JSF), constrained by the mass of the W boson in \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{q{\textbackslash}overline\{q\}'\}\$ decays. The measurement is calibrated on samples simulated at next-to-leading order matched to a leading-order parton shower. The top quark mass is found to be 172.25 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.08 (stat+JSF) \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.62 (syst) GeV. The dependence of this result on the kinematic properties of the event is studied and compared to predictions of different models of \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{t{\textbackslash}overline\{t\}\}\$ production, and no indications of a bias in the measurements are observed.},

The measurement uses events in which a W boson decays to a neutrino and either a muon or an electron. The data sample of proton-proton collisions recorded with the CMS detector at the LHC in 2016 corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$. The differential cross section and its value normalized to the total inclusive W boson production cross section are measured over the rapidity range \${\textbar}y\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{W\}{\textbar}\$ \${\textbackslash}lt\$ 2.5.
